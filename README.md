# Might
Homage to Heroes of Might &amp; Magic

Might is intended to be an homage to the combat system from Heroes of Might and Magic. There's a features roadmap I have saved elsewhere, I'll add it here eventually.
This will become an Android app but for now runs on Linux through either the console or QtCreator. To get it working on other platforms, find an alternative to ncurses.
Pursuant to the above, all code contributed to this project is done so under the full acknowledgement that this will be monetised and that all proceeds go towards shektek.
