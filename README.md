# Might
Homage to Heroes of Might &amp; Magic

Might is intended to be an homage to the combat system from Heroes of Might and Magic. There's a features roadmap in might.txt.
This is built for Linux using SDL, but there are no Linux-specific functions used so porting should be easy. There is a console host instead of SDL, but that uses ncurses and hasn't been updated for a while.
Pursuant to the above, all code contributed to this project is done so under the full acknowledgement that this will be monetised and that all proceeds go towards shektek.
