# Might
Homage to Heroes of Might &amp; Magic

Might is intended to be an homage to the combat system from Heroes of Might and Magic. 
Read the features roadmap in might.txt.
This is built for Linux using SDL, but there are no Linux-specific functions used so porting should be easy. 
There is a console host instead of SDL, but that uses ncurses and hasn't been updated for a while.
There is also a Windows version in the WinMight directory that has Visual Studio 2019 project files.
