fixing the main loop:
	- separate main loop into input -> update -> render
	- move the unit control into the game master
	- animate moving units, lock input
	- when animation is done, proceed to next unit
	- once the last unit has moved, swap players

MOVEMENT PHASE
-Use a flow path for pathfinding
-Fix the sprite scale/location
-Separate the render/input functions
-Move unit rendering into RenderUnit
