DONE | Unit.h          - a deployed unit in an army
DONE | AnimatedUnitFactory.h	- Convert a standard Unit into an AnimatedUnit by getting the required AnimatedImage sets
VOID | UnitType.h      - a template of a unit: attacks, health, portrait, battlefield graphics, etc.
DONE | UnitFactory.h   - functions to create an instance of a unit from a unit type
VOID | Army.h          - a player's deployed army
ArmyFactory.h   - functions to create an army from some source or random
DONE | Faction.h       - a template of what is available to a faction: heroes, unit types, etc.
Barracks.h      - contains a selection of available units to recruit

	--Attacks--

	--Animation--
GameState - used by the GameMaster to determine what should be happening on screen


Unit control takes place in three states, which must be played in order but can be skipped:
- hero phase
	o Cast spells
	o Skip this unit
	o Surrender
	o Retreat
- move phase
	o Move to a given square (relies on pathing!)
	o If an attack order is included, move to the appropriate adjacent square
- attack phase
	o While there are available attacks in the sequence (some units can switch targets)
		apply damage to enemy
		check if the attack allows a transition back to move phase

Start turn, select unit
Click location, check validity
	- Set game state to move phase
	- iterate the move animation while the unit is not yet at its target
Move unit
Execute attack
	if Enemy isn't dead and can counterattack, call enemy's attack
		if Unit isn't dead and can riposte, execute riposte
End turn
