TODO

-Add factions and unit types
-Add UI elements to display unit info
-Use flow path to generate navigable grid
-Fix the sprite scale/location


	--Armies--
DONE | AnimatedImage.h - a collection of images and frame coordinates, with ways to iterate through them
DONE | Unit.h          - a deployed unit in an army
UnitConverter.h	- Convert a standard Unit into an AnimatedUnit by getting the required AnimatedImage sets
UnitType.h      - a template of a unit: attacks, health, portrait, battlefield graphics, etc.
UnitFactory.h   - functions to create an instance of a unit from a unit type
Army.h          - a player's deployed army
ArmyFactory.h   - functions to create an army from some source or random
DONE | Faction.h       - a template of what is available to a faction: heroes, unit types, etc.
Barracks.h      - contains a selection of available units to recruit

	Current bottlenecks:
 - RenderSDL doesn't have a way to render AnimatedUnit types and needs the UnitConverter
