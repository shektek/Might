MIGHT
general design:
turn based
the battlefield is a table of square tiles with random obstacles spread around
players are assigned equal points with amount depending on battle type
players can select a starting formation for troops
individual troops have hit points, attack damage, etc.
troops are arranged into stacks which are dealt with as single units
all abilities should be considered cumulative unless otherwise stated
players face off 1 on 1, can field 5 (6?) stacks of units that are purchased according to the number of battle points
units are arranged on the battlefield
movement is in order of speed priority
the player is represented by a HERO unit that casts spells and provides buffs - does not engage in combat

units are of three armour levels
	light	- gambeson, doublet, leather, fur, none
	medium	- chainmail, scale, light plate (e.g. breastplate and greaves)
	heavy	- full plate, stoneplate, feathered bronze
non magical attacks have four types
	slash	- 1.5x damage against light armour
	pierce	- 1.5x damage against medium armour
	crush	- 1.5x damage against heavy armour
	hack	- 1.2x damage against light/heavy armour
magical attacks have various effects depending on the unit, see the descriptions below
units with multiple attacks can target switch unless otherwise stated. I've been explicit in most places anyway.

players can level up and access new spells and abilities
players can only fight at their level or 1 std dev above - this is recalculated every day to adjust to the maximum level players
players with a high win/loss ratio are more likely to play higher rated opponents

features roadmap:
 - first iteration (pre-release):
		Basic combat system (advanced spells and special attacks not included)
		Preset formations
		Army must be chosen before each battle
		Hero applies buffs before battle
		Basic matchmaking (match to win/loss ratio)
		GUI version is functional, but with placeholder art
		
 - second iteration (first release):
		Advanced combat system (to be considered "complete" at this point)
		Player-created custom formations
		Army slots allow players to pre-build armies for different points levels
		Hero can apply buffs during battle
		Refined matchmaking and direct challenges
		GUI is done with proper art
		
 - third iteration (first major update):
		Players accumulate gold after battles, victor gets base amount + skill difference, loser gets smaller amount
		"Realms" introduced
			Players can travel to other lands
			Can build encampments to recruit unique units and fight mobs
			Can build castles to unlock advanced unique units, siege other players castles, slowly gain passive experience for heroes
		Bounties can be placed on other players after battle
			A player can only have a limited amount of bounties on them
			A player can only place a limited amount of bounties on others
			The bounty costs a certain amount to place, which is recouped with a bonus upon the player being defeated
			Bounties cannot be placed on a player for some time after they are defeated (to prevent farming top/bottom players)
			Bounties have a cool down of some time after they are fulfilled, so players can't spam them
		
design direction:
Mid-late 90s aesthetic (HOMM2)
No cash-grab "mobile game" pay to win crap - this is an actual game that could conceivably be released on any platform
Paid items are completely optional and do not confer an advantage
Account for time per game (Chess.com style) with overall-timed live or per-turn-time-out correspondence games
Animations should be 4-6 frames so as to look janky and old school
